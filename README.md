# How do we measure peoples opinion on the national TV program?

In this project I conduct Topic Modelling and Sentiment Analysis of some of the top program in Indonesian National Television such as Jejak Petualang, My Trip My Adventure, Ambyar and so much more using Youtube's Comment Section.

## What you'll need to run this project:
1. Youtube API Key : This is needed to scrape the comments from the videos you desire, you could perform scraping wihtout this but it would take more time than just using the Youtube API. You could get a hold of the API Key by creating your credentials through Google Cloud Console.
2. Channel Id or Playlist ID : This is also needed for the scraping part of the comments section, there will be different function based on what type of sources you use such as directly from the channel or from an already created playlist on youtube. You would need to right-click the channel or playlist and then see the page sources to finally find the Id by just using ctr+f.
3. Files or lists of stopwords, negative words, positive words, slang words : This will be provided in this repository but in case you have different approaches or purpose you could also just replace the files provided with the one you want.
